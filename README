# sfMediaBrowserPlugin (for symfony 1.2 and 1.1) #

The `sfMediaBrowserPlugin` is a symfony plugin that provides file managment
by uploading, editing and browsing files and directories.

It does not lay on database, is cross-platform, form file browser widget included, 
 even compatible as a tinymce file browser and easily extendable.

Even though it it fully rewritten, this plugin was inspired from sfMediaLibraryPlugin
in its layout design (not code) and easy functionalities.
Considering these, it also aims theses goals :

- keep what the sfMediaLibraryPlugin does.
- make it compatible with newest symfony stable version (1.2 as of today, 1.3 and 1.4 soon)
and keep it updated.
- write it with less code, more extensible, more error managment.
- add file editing capabilities.

      - Setup your tinyMCE.init with this option :
      {{{
        ...
        file_browser_callback: "sfMediaBrowserWindowManager.tinymceCallback"
      }}}
